//# denominator must be constant in division
let x = 1 / (3..4)
//          ^^^^^^ denominator is a runtime value

//# constant operand is not a multiple of variable operand's step
let y = (1..10 by 1/10) + 1/3 
//                        ^^^ found value 1/3
//      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ found variable with step size of 1/10

//# range bounds must be a multiple of step (1)
let z = 0..5.2
//      ^ found minimum 0
//         ^^^ found maximum 26/5

//# range upper bound must be greater than lower bound
let a = 7..2
//      ^ found minimum 7
//         ^ found maximum 2

//# range step must be nonzero
let b = 1..10 by 0
//               ^ found step 0
