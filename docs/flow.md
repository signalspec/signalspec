# Blocks: Control and data flow

Blocks are connected via two streams of tokens.
Blocks have a "bottom" token stream connecting to the abstraction below (lower-level, closer to hardware), and optionally provide a "top" token stream connecting to the abstraction above. The block converts between lower-level tokens and higher-level tokens. The types of these streams are inferred


### <code><var>token</var> [<b>{</b> <var>body</var> <b>}</b>]</code>

A bare expression used as a statement transacts a token on the bottom token stream. The expression is down-evaluated and sent to the block below on the abstraction stack. That block replies with a value that is up-evaluated on the expression.

If the action on the upper block involves a sub-stream, a body may be provided, which will be matched against the sub-stream.

### `seq`

A series of statements separated by newlines or semicolons are matched in order.

The program `#a ; #b ; #c`, matches exactly the series of symbol tokens `#a`, `#b`, `#c`, and generates the same series of tokens.

### `with`

<code><b>with</b> <var>fn</var> <b>{</b> <var>body</var> <b>}</b></code>

The `with` block maps tokens bidirectionally through a function. Tokens received on the top token stream are down-evaluated through the provided function and passed to the bottom token stream. Tokens received on the bottom stream are up-evaluated through the function and passed to the top token stream.

Its main purpose is partial application / currying of streams. This can be optimized into run-length encoding for sampled signals or loop invariant code motion for signals backed by hardware registers.

### `repeat`

<code><b>repeat</b> <var>n</var> <b>{ </b> <var>(first) ; [rest]</var> <b>};</b> <var>(follow...)</var></code>

Perform the actions in the block repeatedly. If the first token expression (recursively) of the body can be disambiguated via up-evaluation from the first token expression of the block after the repeat statement, they must be identical in the down direction. The number of repetitions is bounded by the signal by determining which expression matches at the beginning of each loop iteration, and the count is up-evaluated into expression `n`. Otherwise, `n` is down-evaluated, and the body repeated that many times.

In sampled signals, this is used to measure and set the time duration of signal features.

### `for`

<code><b>for</b> <var>e1</var><b>=</b><var>v1</var>, <var>e2</var><b>=</b><var>v2</var> <var>...</var> { <var>body</var> }</code>

`for` breaks a vector into a series of actions.

`v1`, `v2`, ... `vn` must be vectors with the same length `x`. The body is executed `x` times (`i` from `0` to `x`), with `e1`, `e2` ... `en` bidirectionally bound to the `i`th element of the corresponding vector.


### `switch` / `when`

<code><b>switch</b> <var>expr</var> <b> { when</b> <var>expr1</var> <b> { </b><var>body1</var><b> } when</b> <var>expr2</var> <b> { </b><var>body2</var><b> }</b> <var>...</var> <b>}</b>

If the first token expression of each of `body1`, `body2`, <code>body<var>n</var></code> can be disambiguated in the up direction, they must be identical in the down direction. The choice of branch is determined by which first token expression matches. `expr` is up-evaluated with <code>expr<var>n</var></code> corresponding to the branch taken.

Otherwise, `expr` is down-evaluated and matched against <code>expr<var>n</var></code>. The first matching branch is taken.

### `on`

<code><b>on</b> <var>expr</var> <b>{ }</b></code>

`on` blocks define the tokens exposed to the abstraction stacked on top of this one.

A token is received from the top stream and destructured into `expr`, binding down-evaluable variables in scope in the body. The body may up-evaluate into variables created in expr. On exit from the body, the up-evaluated components of `expr` are sent as a token on the top stream.

### `par`

TBD
